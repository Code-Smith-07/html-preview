   cd html-preview
   ```

2. **Open the Editor**:
   - Simply open `Apps.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server for the best experience:
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using Node.js
     npx http-server

   - Extract the ZIP to get your HTML, CSS, and JS files

## 📖 How It Works

### File Linking
When you download your project as a ZIP file, the files are named based on your input. For example, if you name your project "MyWebsite", you'll get:
- `MyWebsite.html`
- `MyWebsite.css`
- `MyWebsite.js`

**Important**: Make sure to link your CSS and JavaScript files correctly in your HTML:

```html
<!-- Link CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="MyWebsite.css">

<!-- Link JavaScript -->
<script src="MyWebsite.js"></script>
```
